        Martin from our band has been helping out with Maison Elizabeth House in
        NDG.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maison Elizabeth House is an NPO that offers support services to young
        parents experiencing difficulties.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you don't have a copy of our 2006 self titled LP on vinyl (or want to
        get it for someone as a holiday gift), now is the time! Copies can be
        picked up from Phonopolis record store in Montreal, or we can ship em
        :).
        <br />
        <br />
        All proceeds from any digital or physical sales of the band's
        self-titled on Bandcamp (until the end of the year) will go towards this
        local Montreal charity. Link below!
